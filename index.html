				[Chorus]
				May I stand unshaken
				Amid, amidst a crash of worlds?
            </p>
            <p>
				[Verse 1]
				Did I hear a thunder?
				Did I hear you break?
				I can't quite remember
				Just what guided me this way, oh
            </p>            
            <p>
				[Chorus]
				May I stand unshaken
				Amid, amidst a crash of worlds?
            </p>            
             <p>
				[Verse 2]
				The pines, they often whisper
				They whisper what no tongue can tell
				He who drinks from the deep water
				May he know the depths of the well
				World
            </p>            
            <p>
				[Chorus]
				May I stand unshaken
				Amid, amidst a crash of worlds?
				May I stand unshaken
				Amid, amidst a crash of worlds?
            </p>            
            <p>
                [Verse 3]
				Mmm, oh, traveler
				What have you seen?
				Were there crossroads
				Where you been, where you been?
				I once was standing tall
			    Now I feel my back is against the wall
            </p>            
            <p>
				[Chorus]
				May I stand unshaken
				Amid, amidst a crash of worlds?
				May I stand unshaken
				Amid, amidst a crash of worlds?

				Oh, oh
				Oh
            </p>            
            <p>
				[Verse 4]
				The morning light
				When it comes to me
				It was there but I could not see
				Am I to wander
				As a wayward son?
				Will the hunter be hunted
				By the smoking gun?
            </p>            
            <p>
				[Outro]
				May I stand unshaken (ah), shaken
				Amid, amid a crash of worlds (worlds)
				May I stand unshaken
				Amid, amid a crash of worlds (worlds)
				May I stand unshaken
				Amid, amid a crash of worlds (worlds)

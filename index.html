				[Chorus]
				May I stand unshaken
				Amid, amidst a crash of worlds?

				[Verse 1]
				Did I hear a thunder?
				Did I hear you break?
				I can't quite remember
				Just what guided me this way, oh

				[Chorus]
				May I stand unshaken
				Amid, amidst a crash of worlds?

				[Verse 2]
				The pines, they often whisper
				They whisper what no tongue can tell
				He who drinks from the deep water
				May he know the depths of the well
				World
